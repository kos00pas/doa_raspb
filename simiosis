sudo chrt -f 99 /home/kos00pas/doa_env/bin/python main.py should not make the situation worse. In fact, it is designed to give your script the highest real-time priority, which can help reduce audio interruptions.

sudo nano /etc/asound.conf

        type plug
        slave.pcm "hw:0,0"  # Headphones
    }
    capture.pcm {

        slave.pcm "hw:3,0"  # ReSpeaker

Ignore ALSA Warnings:

If your audio devices are functioning correctly despite the warnings, you can usually ignore them. The warnings indicate that certain configuration files or control elements are missing, but this doesnâ€™t necessarily affect normal operation.
