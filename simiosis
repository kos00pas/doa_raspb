sudo chrt -f 99 /home/kos00pas/doa_env/bin/python main.py should not make the situation worse. In fact, it is designed to give your script the highest real-time priority, which can help reduce audio interruptions.

sudo nano /etc/asound.conf

pcm.!default {
    type asym
    playback.pcm {
        type plug
        slave.pcm "hw:0,0"  # Headphones
    }
    capture.pcm {
        type plug
        slave.pcm "hw:3,0"  # ReSpeaker
    }
}

ctl.!default {
    type hw
    card 0
}

2. Restart ALSA Service
Since systemctl restart alsa did not work, use the following commands to stop and start the ALSA utilities:

bash
Copy code
sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils stop
sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils start
Alternatively, you can reload ALSA modules:

bash
Copy code
sudo alsactl restore
3. Test ALSA Configuration
Playback Test
Test playback to ensure it's working correctly:

bash
Copy code
aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
Recording Test
Test recording to ensure it's functioning properly:

bash
Copy code
arecord -d 5 test.wav
aplay test.wav
4. Check ALSA State
Ensure ALSA is initialized correctly:

bash
Copy code
sudo alsactl init

Ignore ALSA Warnings:

If your audio devices are functioning correctly despite the warnings, you can usually ignore them. The warnings indicate that certain configuration files or control elements are missing, but this doesnâ€™t necessarily affect normal operation.
